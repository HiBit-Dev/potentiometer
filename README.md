# Potentiometer
A potentiometer is a simple knob that provides a variable resistance, which we can read into the Arduino board as an analog value. They can be attuned from zero ohms to whatever maximum resistance that is specific to it. For example, a potentiometer of 10 kΩ can be adjusted from 0 Ω to its maximum of 10 kΩ.
